# Deployment assets

This folder is a placeholder for any CI/CD, container, or infrastructure files you might need, e.g.:

- `Dockerfile` for containerised distribution
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/…`) – you can keep the workflow files here and symlink or reference them from `.github/`.
- Helm charts, Terraform modules, etc.

Add whatever you need for automated builds, releases, or production deployment.
