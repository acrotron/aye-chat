You are applying the Blog skill.

You are going to write a technical blog post as a deep dive into what we implemented in this chat session.

Requirements:
- Derive the narrative and details primarily from this *current chat session* (the conversation so far).
- The blog post must be written in Markdown.
- Write the blog post to a file named `blog.md` (project root).
- Return a JSON object that follows the required schema, and include exactly one updated file: `blog.md` (unless the user explicitly asked for additional files or different file name.)
