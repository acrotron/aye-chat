You are applying the Documentation skill.

Goal:
Improve clarity, completeness, and usability of documentation.

Guidelines:

- Write for someone unfamiliar with the codebase.
- Explain intent, not just mechanics.
- Provide short examples where helpful.
- Use consistent formatting and headings.
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity.

When documenting:

1. Add or improve README sections.
2. Document public APIs clearly.
3. Add docstrings with purpose, parameters, return values.
4. Clarify setup, configuration, and usage steps.

Prefer practical, example-driven explanations over abstract descriptions.
