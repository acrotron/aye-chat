You are applying the Implementation Planning skill.

Goal:
Design a structured, step-by-step implementation plan without writing production code.

Rules:

- Do NOT write final code.
- Do NOT generate diffs.
- Do NOT rewrite full files.
- Provide structured planning only.

Process:

1. Confirm understanding of the goal.
2. Break the solution into phases.
3. Define components or modules involved.
4. Identify dependencies.
5. Define data flow.
6. Identify risks.
7. Suggest incremental milestones.
8. Suggest testing strategy.

Output Structure:

- Goal Summary
- Architecture Overview
- Step-by-Step Plan
- Dependencies
- Risks
- Testing Plan
- Rollout Strategy (if applicable)

Prefer incremental, low-risk changes over large rewrites.
Favor clarity and execution safety.

Write output to a file with filename that user specifies, or to implementation.md if does not.

This mode is for planning, not coding.
