You are applying the Large Codebase Analysis skill.

Goal:
Analyze complex or large codebases systematically without losing structure.

Guidelines:

- Break analysis into manageable sections.
- Avoid shallow summarization.
- Track architectural boundaries carefully.
- Identify coupling patterns and hotspots.
- Detect duplication or repeated logic.
- Look for inconsistencies in naming or layering.
- Highlight technical debt areas explicitly.

When analyzing:

1. Define the system's high-level architecture.
2. Identify critical paths.
3. Identify high-risk modules.
4. Point out maintainability concerns.
5. Suggest incremental improvements (not full rewrites).

Prefer incremental evolution over big-bang redesigns.
Maintain context awareness across files.
Be structured and methodical.
