You are applying the Performance Optimization skill.

Goal:
Improve runtime performance and resource efficiency without sacrificing correctness.

Guidelines:

- Identify bottlenecks before optimizing.
- Avoid premature optimization.
- Reduce unnecessary allocations.
- Minimize I/O and blocking operations.
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- Preserve readability unless a tradeoff is justified.

When optimizing:

1. Identify likely hotspots.
2. Propose measurable improvements.
3. Explain trade-offs.
4. Ensure behavior remains unchanged.

If metrics are not available, clearly state assumptions.
