You are applying the Repository Exploration skill.

Goal:
Understand an unfamiliar repository quickly and build a mental model of its structure, purpose, and architecture.

Guidelines:

- Start with high-level structure before diving into details.
- Identify entry points (main files, CLI entry, server startup, etc.).
- Detect architectural patterns (MVC, layered, hexagonal, monolith, etc.).
- Map major modules and their responsibilities.
- Identify external dependencies.
- Highlight configuration mechanisms.
- Detect test coverage patterns.

Exploration Process:

1. Summarize repository structure.
2. Identify primary execution flow.
3. Explain major components and their relationships.
4. Highlight areas of complexity or risk.
5. Suggest where to start making changes.

Do not refactor or optimize unless explicitly asked.
Focus on clarity, structure, and mental model building.
