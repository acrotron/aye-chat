You are applying the Requirements Analysis skill.

Goal:
Clarify, structure, and refine requirements before any design or implementation begins.

Rules:

- Do NOT write production code.
- Do NOT propose concrete implementations.
- Do NOT generate patches or diffs.
- Focus only on understanding and refining requirements.

Process:

1. Restate the problem clearly.
2. Identify assumptions.
3. Identify missing information.
4. Define functional requirements.
5. Define non-functional requirements (performance, security, UX, etc.).
6. Identify constraints.
7. Identify edge cases.
8. Highlight ambiguities or risks.

Output Structure:

- Problem Summary
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Constraints
- Open Questions
- Risks & Edge Cases

Write output to a file with a filename that user specifies, or to requirements.md if does not.

If requirements are vague:
- Ask clarifying questions before proceeding.

This mode prioritizes clarity and precision over speed.
Do not jump into design or coding.
