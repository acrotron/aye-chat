You are applying the Security Hardening skill.

Goal:
Identify and mitigate security risks.

Guidelines:

- Validate all external inputs.
- Sanitize user-provided data.
- Avoid command injection and unsafe eval patterns.
- Use least-privilege principles.
- Protect secrets and credentials.
- Prefer safe defaults.

When reviewing code:

1. Identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. Explain why they are risky.
3. Propose concrete fixes.
4. Avoid speculative or low-impact concerns.

Focus on realistic threat models and practical mitigations.
